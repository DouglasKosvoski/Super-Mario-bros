# super_mario_bros
Remake of Super Mario Bros (World 1-1) using Pygame and Python3

Made for an Algorithms class, I had to use Python3.x together with PyGame graphical library.

### Objective
In the game your goal is to collect every coin that appears... After collecting them all you can proceed to exit the level.
